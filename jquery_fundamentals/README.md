# jQuery Fundamentals

These exercises aim to give you some experience doing DOM manipulation with jQuery and reading the jQuery API documentation.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the **[jQuery API](http://api.jquery.com)** open in a tab in your browser. You'll need to look up the different functions that jQuery provides there to solve the problems in this assignment.

**Reading technical documentation is a really important skill!** Spend a little bit of time looking at the docs for the [`.css`](http://api.jquery.com/css/) function to make sure you understand the layout of the docs and where to look for different kinds of information.

## Instructions

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
	- In your web browser, just use File -> Open and find `index.html` or,
	- In Sublime Text, open `index.html`, right-click anywhere and click `Open in Browser`
2. Open `jquery_exercises.js` in your text editor
3. If you don't know where to begin with an exercise, you can use the hint provided in each exercise to lookup the appropriate function in the jQuery API. Feel free to solve the problem in a different way than the hint suggests.
4. If you are stuck for longer than 10 minutes on an exercise, ask a classmate, ask an instructor or move on to the next exercise.
